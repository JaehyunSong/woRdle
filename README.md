## Arguments

A function `wordle()` has two arguments&mdash;`answer` and `strict`.

* `answer`: `"installed"` (default), `"cran"`, `"ranking"`, or any five character.
   * `"installed"`: A pacakge list is obtained from your PC.
   * `"cran"`: A package list is obtained from CRAN.
   * `"ranking`: Top downloaded package list is obtained from CRAN using an R package, {[cranlogs](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cranlogs/index.html)}.
   * You can set any answer with five characters, for example, `"knitr"` or `"seoul"`.
* `strict`: a logical value; `TRUE` (default) or `FALSE`.
   * If `TRUE`, a guess not in package list is not applicable. If `FALSE`, a guess can have any five charcters.
   * This arguments work only when `answer` is `"installed"`, `"cran"`, `"ranking"`.

## Useful functions

* `wordle_list()`: Display a list of package names with five alphabets.
   * `type = "installed"`: A pacakge list is obtained from your PC. (default)
   * `type = "cran"`: A package list is obtained from CRAN.
